This study shows the development and evaluation of an AI-powered conversational agent designed to give academic support and task automation for university students. The system makes use of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with actionable features such as automatic email writing and sending as well as calendar-based reminder setting. Leveraging the university- specific datasets including academic policies, program details, and administrative information the agent employs OpenAI’s embedding API and a FAISS vector database to retrieve and ground responses in authoritative content. The task automation module utilizes Google Calendar and Mailtrap.io APIs, allowing users to manage schedules and communications seamlessly through natural-language commands. Human evaluators involving 15 students assessed the system’s performance across four key criteria: relevance, factual accuracy, clarity, and helpfulness. The results demonstrated strong performance, with average scores of 4.27 for relevance, 4.00 for factual accuracy, 4.20 for clarity, and 3.87 for helpfulness (on a 5-point Likert scale). These findings validate the system’s effectiveness in delivering accurate, contextually relevant responses and executing practical tasks, thereby improving student’s academic organization and productivity. This project shows the potential of conversational AI to transform academic support services by combining information retrieval with proactive task management. Future work will focus on expanding the dataset, integrating additional automation features, and optimizing system performance for larger-scale deployments.
